# Deep-Learning-on-Graphs

### Transductive and Inductive Learning on Graphs

The aim of this project is to get familiar with training and investigating GNNs. The
first part focusses on the transductive learning setting. Here, we are given a single
graph with partial information and the goal is to predict the missing pieces. The
second part is an inductive task. In the inductive setting, we are given a collection
of graphs and try to learn a generalisable predictor applicable to graphs not yet
shown during training.

### GNNs on knowledge and 3D graphs

The aim of this project is to get more experience with GNNs by using them in more
complex applied scenarios. The first part covers prediction tasks on knowledge
graphs. The second part focuses on classification of 3D objects represented in
different ways.
