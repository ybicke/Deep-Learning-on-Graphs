# Deep-Learning-on-Graphs

The aim of this project is to get familiar with training and investigating GNNs. The
first part focusses on the transductive learning setting. Here, we are given a single
graph with partial information and the goal is to predict the missing pieces. The
second part is an inductive task. In the inductive setting, we are given a collection
of graphs and try to learn a generalisable predictor applicable to graphs not yet
shown during training.
